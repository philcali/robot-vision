Robot Vision Control (RVC) is an embedded [unfiltered][1] web server allowing
remote control over the host machine via html 5 technologies, similar to RDP
and VNC.

RVC's source is hosted on [github][2]. Detailed installation and usage
information can be found on the project's [README][3].

Chrome browsers and Chromebooks can take advantage of the [extension][4]
for subvert control connections and managing host URL's.
