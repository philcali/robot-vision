Robot Vision Control (RVC) is an embedded [unfiltered][1] web server allowing
remote control over the host machine similar to RDP and VNC, except control
is handled at the http transport layer.

RVC's source is hosted on [github][2]. Detailed installation and usage
information can be found in the project's [README][3].

Chrome browsers and Chromebooks can take advantage of the [extension][4]
for subvert control connections and managing host URL's. Conveniently
install the extension at the Chrome [webstore][5].
