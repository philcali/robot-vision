# Remote Capture (name is bound to change)

- Netty websocket server to control your machine

The implementation is still in proof of concept phase; however, the results are
looking promising. The end goal is to make a VNC application that is available
for free for Chrome users (Chromebook in particular).

## TODO's

- Popout interface for dynamic controls
- interface for uploading and dowloading files
- localStorage for some settings
- Make conscripted launch for server
- Make client (socket) portion a Chrome Extension
